== Introduction

* Stardy Together (ST) is for *NUS Students* who prefer to use a *desktop app* for managing NUS friends' contacts.
* More importantly, ST is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* If you can type fast, ST can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
* This guide provides a list of features that are available on ST and their usage.
* Interested? Jump to the next section, <<Quick Start>>, to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `StardyTogether.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your StardyTogether.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts and aliases
* **`add`**`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/01011995 tt/http://modsn.us/oNZLY` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to StardyTogether.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
