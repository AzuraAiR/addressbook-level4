== Introduction

* Stardy Together (ST) is for *NUS Students* who prefer to use a *desktop app* for managing NUS friends' contacts.
* More importantly, ST is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* If you can type fast, ST can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
* This guide provides a list of features that are available on ST and their usage.
* Interested? Jump to the next section, <<Quick Start>>, to get started. Enjoy!
