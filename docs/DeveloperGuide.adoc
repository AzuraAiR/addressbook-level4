== Introduction
StardyTogether is a command line application which provides students a way to manage their contacts.
It is customized for students in the National University of Singapore (NUS) which allows them to find vacant rooms within NUS and also to track their timetable.
This documentation provides information that will not only help you get started as a StardyTogether contributor, but that you'll find useful to refer to even if you are already an experienced contributor.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `CS2103JAN2018-W11-B4/main` repo. If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `CS2103JAN2018-W11-B4/main`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::customizedalias[]
=== Customized Alias feature
==== Current Implementation

image::LogicComponentAliasSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How alias list is maintained
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create an `UniqueAliasList` in the `alias` model
** Pros: Reduce coupling between `Alias` and other commands. This design follows the Open Closed Principle where a command is open to extension and closed to modification.
** Cons: More difficult to implement as need to design an instance of a `UniqueAliasList`.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a HashMap of `Alias` in each command class
** Pros: Faster to implement as each command class only needs to include a HashMap that stores all the aliases tagged to the command.
** Cons: High coupling between `Alias` and other commands and the HashMaps of every command needs to be iterated through to find to find the aliased command.

===== Aspect: How alias is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store as `XmlAdaptedAlias` and save to `addressbook.xml`
** Pros: Reduces files where data need to be stored, as all the user saved data is in one file.
** Cons: Need to design a section in `addressbook.xml` for saving alias data with the other data like person data.
* **Alternative 2:** Store in `UserPrefsStorage`
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Affects Import command, to import `UserPrefsStorage` as well, than just importing `addressbook.xml`
// end::customizedalias[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
===  Data Encryption
==== Current Implementation

We are using `javax.crypto.cipher` and `java.security.key` package for the encryption of the data. The `SecurityUtil` class is used to provide the `SHA-1` hashing and `AES` encryption/decryption required.

Using a given password, it is first hashed using `SHA-1` to be used as the `AES` key.
The first 128 bits of the digest created by the `SHA-1` hash is extracted.
This is required as `AES` requires its key to be 128 bits long.

* The encryption can be done simply by using `SecurityUtil.encrypt()` which will encrypt the addressbook.xml.
* The decryption can be done simply by using `SecurityUtil.decrypt()` which will decrypt the addressbook.xml.
* Currently, decryption/encryption is done in `XmlAddressBookStorage` class before/after `readAddressBook` and `saveAddressBook`.

A default password is used if the user do not set a password.
Users can change their password using the command `password`. +
The sequence diagram shows how the `ModelManager` updates the password:

image::PasswordSdForModel.png[width="800"]

The 128 bit password used to encrypt `addressbook.xml` is saved in the address book to ensure that the password is not lost after every reset of the application.
This is secure as even if a malicious user were to somehow get a copy of the 128 bit password, they would still need to use a computationally unfeasible pre-image attack.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to generate the AES key
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generating the key from a password
** Pros: Users are able to key in their own passwords
** Cons: Default password needs to be provided which may make it as insecure as before if users do not change it.
* **Alternative 2:** Generating the key within the code into a file for user to share.
** Pros: It would be guaranteed to be more secure than using our own generated key.
    This is because keys generated by `java.crypto.KeyGenerator` have their algorithms reviewed by many experts in the area.
** Cons: This would require a file to be carried by the user to decrypt their address book which makes it very inconvenient for the user.

===== Aspect: Where to encrypt and decrypt file
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encryption and Decryption done in `XmlAddressBookStorage` class
** Pros: Easy and clear to understand implementation where file is encrypted and decrypted before and after `readAddressBook` and `saveAddressBook`.
** Cons: `addressbook.xml` is in plain text longer than is required.

* **Alternative 2:**  Encryption and Decryption done where needed in `XmlUtil` and `XmlFileStorage`
** Pros: `addressbook.xml` is exposed minimally.
** Cons: Increase coupling of more classes and makes the implementation harder to understand.

===== Aspect: Where to save the password
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save in `addressbook.xml`
** Pros: The password is not lost after every reload of the application.
** Cons: Plaintext of `addressbook.xml` contains the 128 bit `AES` key used.
However, this is still secure as even if a malicious user were to somehow get a copy of the 128 bit password, they would still need to use a computationally unfeasible pre-image attack.

* **Alternative 2:** Password not saved
** Pros: No chance of password being compromised.
** Cons: Password reset after each reload of application.
// end::dataencryption[]

=== Import AddressBook feature
==== Current Implementation

The import AddressBook mechanism is facilitated by `XmlSerializableAddressBook`, which resides inside `Storage`. It allows the imported XML file to be converted into AddressBook format.

The imported AddressBook must be a XML file that follows `XmlAdaptedPerson`, `XmlAdaptedTag`, and `XmlAdaptedAlias` format.

`Person`,`Tag`, and `Alias` from imported AddressBook that are not a duplicate of existing `Person`, `Tag`, and `Alias` in the user's AddressBook will be added.

The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:

image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Imported AddressBook file format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses the same XML file format as `XmlSerializableAddressBook`
** Pros: Same file format as saved AddressBook, users can transfer AddressBook easily without the need to indicate file format.
** Cons: Imported AddressBook must be in XML file format that follows `XmlAdaptedPerson`, `XmlAdaptedTag`, and `XmlAdaptedAlias` format.
* **Alternative 2:** Uses CSV file format
** Pros: CSV file format is widely used and is able to transfer between different applications (eg. Microsoft Excel).
** Cons: Different file format as saved AddressBook, implementation of converting file type from XML to CSV is needed.

===== Aspect: How import command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Adds all `Person`,`Tag`, and `Alias` from imported AddressBook that are not a duplicate of existing `Person`, `Tag`, and `Alias` to the user's AddressBook.
** Pros: User does not need to indicate which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be imported.
** Cons: User is not able to select which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be imported.
* **Alternative 2:** Adds selected `Person`,`Tag`, and `Alias` from imported AddressBook that are not a duplicate of existing `Person`, `Tag`, and `Alias` to the user's AddressBook.
** Pros: User is able to select which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be imported.
** Cons: User needs to indicate which `Person`, `Tag` or `Alias` to be imported.

=== Birthdays feature
==== Current Implementation
Birthdays Command uses the existing Events system and sends an event.

image::LogicComponentBirthdaysSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The UI component will then receive the event and handle the data.

image::UiComponentBirthdayListSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the BirthdayList UI component obtains and parses its data

* **Alternative 1**: Let UI component handle the parsing of UniquePersonList obtained from Event
** Pros: Isolated and independent within BirthdayList UI component. Less overhead.
** Cons: Not intuitive to new developers as parsing of data is not expected in UI.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Let Birthdays do the parsing of UniquePersonList obtained from Model
** Pros: More modularity.
** Cons: Not apparent in usage by User. Functionality remains the same but Birthdays command becomes more cluttered.

===== Aspect: How User can open Birthday List

* **Alternative 1**: Manual command "birthdays" or "birthdays today"
** Pros: User can control when to view the birthdays.
** Cons: Not very user-friendly. Additional parameter cannot be shortened.
* ** Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Notification at the start of app if a birthday is occurring today
** Pros: User can be reminded immediately and need not type the command.
** Cons: Currently, StardyTogether does not have settings to switch on/off the feature. User may find it irritating.

===== Aspect: How User inputs the Birthday parameter in Person class
* ** Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Fixed format as DDMMYYYY
** Pros: Less room for errors.
** Cons: User may not like the DDMMYYYY format.
* **Alternative 2:** Use Natural Language Processing
** Pros: Users can enter their birthday in their preferred format.
** Cons: External API will be used. May introduce unforeseen bugs.

// tag::vacantroomfinder[]
=== Vacant Room Finder feature
==== Current Implementation
We are using Venue Information JSON file from https://nusmods.com/api/2017-2018/2/venueInformation.json[NUSMods] to get the weekly timetable of the venues. To increase the performance of getting the timetable of the venue, we decided to download Venue Information JSON file and have an offline copy stored in our StardyTogether application.

We have added the list of NUS buildings and the list of rooms in each building into the offline copy.

We use `ReadOnlyJsonVenueInformation`, which resides inside `Storage` to read and store the room timetable data inside `nusVenues` in `Room` class, and also store NUS Buildings and their respective rooms inside `nusBuildingsAndRooms` in `Building` class.

To avoid reading the data whenever the `vacant` command is executed, we only read the data once when the `MainApp` starts.

The following sequence diagram shows how the vacant command is parsed:


`ModelManager` will checks if the building is in the list of NUS Buildings, and will throw `BuildingNotFoundException` if the building is not in the list of NUS Buildings.

We have created `Building`, `Room`, `Week`, and `WeekDay` in `Model` to read and store all weekday schedule of all NUS Rooms.

The following architecture diagram shows the model and storage component:

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the logic component of Vacant Room Finder works:


As shown in diagram above, all Rooms weekday schedule will be return in an `ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>` data structure. This result will be shown to the UI on the `InfoPanel`

===== Aspect: Shows list of vacant rooms
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays a list of rooms and the weekday schedule from 0800 to 2100
** Pros: User is able to see which rooms are vacant throughout the day
** Cons: User has to manually find which rooms are vacant at the current time
* **Alternative 2:** Displays a list of vacant rooms at the current time
** Pros: User is able to see which rooms are vacant at current time immediately
** Cons: User is not able to see the room schedule for the whole day

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a Building, Room, Week and Weekday class
** Pros: Follows the Single Responsibility Principle where each class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software
** Cons: More difficult to implement as the design of the flow of work between classes has to be thought out
* **Alternative 2:** Create a static list of rooms in the Building class which has a room schedule for the day
** Pros: Code is shorter
** Cons: The Room and Building class will have schedule-related code which makes the classes messy.

// tag::timetable[]
=== Timetable feature
==== Current Implementation
When adding a Person using the Add Command, users can enter their NUSMods shortened link into the "tt/" field.
The link goes into the TimetableParserUtil class to parse and retrieve the info of the user's modules.
The information is then sorted and added as a list of lessons taken by the user to the Timetable

The main contents of the timetable is stored as TimetableData and is accessed through Timetable.
TimetableData consists of 2 TimetableWeek, which each consist of 5 TimetableDay, which each consist of 24
TimetableSlot (following the 24h clock)

image::TimetableComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

In the event the url provided is invalid or empty, a empty Timetable will be created.
Do take note that there are dummy urls for the purpose of testing. While normal users should not be able to know of their existence,
entering a dummy link will result in a preset timetable being built.

When the user uses the `TimeTableCommand`, it will raise the `TimeTableEvent` which will be caught and handled by the `InfoPanel`.
The `InfoPanel` will swap between `BrowsePanel`, `BirthdayList`, `VenueTable` and `TimeTablePanel` so that the UI would not be too cluttered.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: The use of NUSMods Shortened URLs

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Use NUSMods shortened urls to 'import' the user's timetable over to StardyTogether
** Pros: User-friendly if user already uses NUSMods and knows how to get the shortened link
** Cons: Not helpful to a user who does not use NUSMods. If NUSMods API changes, StardyTogether needs to be updated
* **Alternative 2**: Allow the use of more universal formats such as .ics files
** Pros: More flexibility for the user
** Cons: Hard to implement and parse the input

===== Aspect: Behaviour of the app when data from API is not retrieved successfully

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): A empty timetable is created for them.
** Pros: Prevents unexpected errors
** Cons: Not very intuitive unless user sees the thrown exception
* ** Alternative 2**: Prevent the adding of a Person without a valid timetable
** Pros: Warns the user that the timetable is not inputted properly
** Cons: Not very user-friendly if user just does not have a valid timetable

===== Aspect: Testing of Timetable

* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Dummy links (which will never be generated by NUSMods) are used,
 Timetable will parse those differently
** Pros: Allows for easy creation of dummy timetables
** Cons: Although unlikely, user may be able to enter the dummy link as his own timetable (unintended behaviour)
* ** Alternative 2**: Changing value to be non-final, settable with a method
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Allows possible unauthorized access to Timetable

===== Aspect: Displaying of Timetable in UI
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Change between the different panels
** Pros: UI would not be too cluttered.
** Cons: User cannot simultaneously use the different panels.
* **Alternative 2:** Have a dedicated spot in the UI for `TimeTablePanel`
** Pros: Easy to refer for users.
** Cons: UI would be confusing and cluttered.

===== Aspect: Size of Timetable size
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Automatically resize according to the size of the Application
** Pros: Size is adaptable to the size of the Application.
** Cons: Variable size may make it confusing for users.
* **Alternative 2:** Fixed Size
** Pros: Easy and predictable size and location of timings.
** Cons: Since display may different from computer to computer, it would be inflexible to use a one size fit all approach.

===== Aspect: Color of Modules in Timetable
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Automatically randomized based on the `hashcode()` of the module name
** Pros: Colors are fixed and more or less randomized.
** Cons: Colors may be same for different modules in the same timetable and Colors are not customizable.
* **Alternative 2:** Pre-defined colors for the different modules
** Pros: No overlap in color and different color for each module
** Cons: Since there are many different modules in NUS, it would be very time-consuming and almost impossible to be implemented.
* **Alternative 3:** User customize colors
** Pros: Customized Application for users.
** Cons: Implementation of this system would be complex and time-consuming, it would be implemented in later versions.
Current implementation is the best in terms of variability and ease of implementation.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
